# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization 🌐

An interactive web-based visualization of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool lets you step through the algorithm manually or watch it auto-play, with real-time graph updates, pseudocode highlighting, and a dynamic distance table.

## 🧠 Features

- **Visual Graph**: Nodes and weighted edges displayed on a canvas
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Click through each algorithm step to see how it works
- **Auto-Play Mode**: Sit back and watch the algorithm run automatically
- **Pseudocode Highlighting**: Tracks which part of the algorithm is executing in real-time
- **Distance Table**: See how distances and paths are updated
- **Reset Button**: Start fresh anytime

## 📁 File

- `dijkstra.html` — The main file; open it in any modern web browser.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the `dijkstra.html` file.
2. Open the file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open dijkstra.html  # macOS
   # or
   start dijkstra.html # Windows
   # or simply double-click the file
   ```

## 🎮 Controls

- **Start**: Begins the algorithm from the selected start node.
- **Next Step**: Advances one step at a time.
- **Auto-Play**: Animates the full process with a short delay between steps.
- **Reset**: Clears the state to allow re-running.

## 🎓 Educational Value

This project is ideal for:
- Students learning graph algorithms
- Instructors teaching Dijkstra's algorithm
- Anyone who prefers visual + interactive learning

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, responsive design)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks!)
